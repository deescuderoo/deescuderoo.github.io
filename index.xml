      <description>Daniel Escudero   Hello! Welcome to my homepage. I am Daniel Escudero. Since September 2021 I am a cryptography researcher at JP Morgan AI Research. Prior to this, starting on May 2017 until August 2021, I was PhD student at the Cryptography and Security group at Aarhus University, Denmark, working under the supervision of Ivan Damgård, Jesper Buus Nielsen and Peter Scholl. I obtained my Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Mathematics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2016 where I had the valuable opportunity to work in a research project on Multivariate Public Key Cryptography during the last two years of my studies.</description>

      <description>A Crash Course on MPC  I am working on a series of posts explaining MPC from the ground up.
 The following are the current posts online:
 Part 0, Introduction Part 1, Basic Terminology and Essential Results Part 2, Two-Party Computation using Beaver/Multiplication Triples Part 3, Shamir Secret-Sharing Part 4, Honest-Majority MPC with Passive Security Part 5, Error Detection and Error Correction Part 6: MPC with Active Security for t&amp;lt;n/3 Part 7: Honest-Majority MPC with Active Security Part 8: Two-Party MPC with Active Security    An Introduction to Secret-Sharing-Based Secure Multiparty Computation   I&amp;#39;m in the process of writing an accessible, comprehensive and self-contained introduction to (secret-sharing) based multiparty computation.</description>
