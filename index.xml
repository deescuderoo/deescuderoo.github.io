      <description>Daniel Escudero Hello! Welcome to my homepage. I am Daniel Escudero, and I am a Research Scientist at JP Morgan AlgoCRYPT Center of Excellence. Prior to this, starting on May 2017 until August 2021, I was a PhD student at the Cryptography and Security group at Aarhus University, Denmark, working under the supervision of Ivan Damgård, Jesper Buus Nielsen and Peter Scholl. I obtained my Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Mathematics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2016 where I had the valuable opportunity to work in a research project on Multivariate Public Key Cryptography during the last two years of my studies.</description>
